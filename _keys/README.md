# _keys

This directory will be moved to a local location and removed from this repository. Its only function is to make development easier across multiple platforms, so that keys can be used by everyone contributing to this project.

## Future location

When implemented, it will be stored in a different location than the `aisecurity` package, most likely `~/keys`.
